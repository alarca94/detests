# DETESTS IberLEF 2022

The DETESTS (DETEction and classification of racial STereotypes in Spanish) task will take place as part of IberLEF 2022, the 4th Workshop on Iberian Languages Evaluation Forum at the SEPLN 2022 Conference, which will be held in A Coruña on 20 September 2021 in Spain.

The aim of the task is to detect and classify stereotypes in sentences from comments posted in Spanish in response to different online news articles related to immigration. A comment can contain multiple stereotypes belonging to different categories and, therefore, it may have multiple labels that need to be accurately detected. This scenario is known in the literature as a multi-label classification problem. However, to adapt the problem to a variety of participants’ interest, the task is designed in a hierarchical fashion by chaining two subtasks and allowing participants to either model the simple binary scenario or complete the entire pipeline by modeling the complex multi-label classification problem.
